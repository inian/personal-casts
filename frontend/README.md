# Meme Maker
Built with Next.JS, Supabase, Tailwind, and Fabric.JS. Under Supabase specifically, the services integrated include the database itself, authentication and storage, along with the relevant security rules written via policies. Oh and everything was done via the Supabase dashboard which is really nifty.

A project built for [Supabase's Hackathon]('https://supabase.io/blog/2021/07/30/1-the-supabase-hackathon'), probably will not be maintained thereafter. A very simplified interface to build and share memes!
